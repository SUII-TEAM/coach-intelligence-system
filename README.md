## Overview

![img](imgs/AI%20Taweek%20Competition.png)


This project aims to build an agent-based system capable of:
- Planning and visualizing strategies (e.g., formations).
- Retrieving and analyzing data in real-time from internal and external sources.
- Engaging in voice-based conversation and interaction.
- Offering in-game support through data retrieval, analysis, and strategic suggestions.

## Core Components

### 1. Planning

- **Purpose**: Generate strategic plans (e.g., formations like 4-3-3) based on input from other agents or data sources.  
- **Key Tasks**:
  - Create a new plan if the existing plan is not performing well.
  - Collaborate with other agents to ensure up-to-date strategies.
  - Provide visual representations of the plan for clarity.

### 2. RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

- **Purpose**: Search relevant documents, databases, or knowledge bases to gather information that enriches the system’s responses and decisions.  
- **Key Tasks**:
  - Retrieve relevant data for conversation or decision-making.
  - Integrate search results to guide planning and strategy.

### 3. Search Tool

- **Purpose**: Scrape and query the web or external sources for real-time data.  
- **Key Tasks**:
  - Collect updated information about matches or game events.
  - Provide external context to refine plans and strategies.

### 4. In Game

- **Purpose**: Provide real-time in-game data for both your team and the opposing team.  
- **Key Tasks**:
  - Connect to an external or specialized game database to fetch current match data.
  - At specific intervals (e.g., every minute or a defined time range), update the plan or strategy based on the latest game events.
  - Generate concise reports with suggestions or adjustments to the current strategy.

#### Tool 1 (Automated)
- Fetch data from the real-time api-football (both the plan and the ongoing match events) and store in the DB.

#### Tool 2 (Analysis)
- Analyze match events and output actionable insights (e.g., recommended tactical changes).

### 5. Voice

- **Purpose**: Enable voice-based interaction with the system.  
- **Key Tasks**:
  - Convert speech to text (STT) for input to the system.
  - Convert text responses from the system to speech (TTS) for user feedback.

### 6. Visualizer

- **Purpose**: Present data and plans in an easily understandable format.  
- **Key Tasks**:
  - Take inputs (e.g., formations or strategies) from other agents.
  - Generate visual representations (e.g., formation layouts, dashboards).

## How It All Works Together

1. **Data Collection**  
   - The **Search Tool** and **RAG** component gather data from both external (web scraping, knowledge bases) and internal (databases, documents) sources.
2. **Planning & Analysis**  
   - The **Planning** agent uses this data to propose or update strategies (e.g., formation changes).
   - **Tool 1** (automated) retrieves real-time match data, while **Tool 2** analyzes it to produce suggestions.
3. **Visualization & Voice Interaction**  
   - The **Visualizer** presents updated strategies in an accessible format.
   - The **Voice** component allows users to receive and provide information through speech, enabling hands-free interaction.
4. **Iteration & Feedback**  
   - In-game performance data feeds back into the system, prompting updated strategies as the match progresses.
   - The system can pivot to new plans if the current approach underperforms.

## Potential Use Cases

1. **Live Match Coaching**  
   - Coaches receive minute-by-minute suggestions based on real-time data.
   - Voice integration enables quick hands-free commands and updates.
2. **Automated Strategy Updates**  
   - The Planning agent automatically adapts formations if performance metrics fall below certain thresholds.
3. **Post-Match Analysis**  
   - The system reviews match events to suggest improvements for future matches.

## Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourRepo/agent-features.git
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies**  
   - Ensure you have Python (or the relevant language environment) set up.
   - Install required packages (e.g., via `pip install -r requirements.txt`).
3. **Configure Data Sources**  
   - Set up your database or connect to the external services for match data.
   - Provide any API keys or credentials needed for the Search Tool or RAG.
